# Dependently-Typed Lambda Experiment

A dependently typed lambda calulus, implemented in Jetbrains MPS.

## Acknowledgment

This project is based on [Andrej Bauer's excellent tutorial "how to implement dependent type theory"](http://math.andrej.com/2012/11/08/how-to-implement-dependent-type-theory-i/) (part I).

## Remarks

I followed through part I of the tutorial (which means that normalization is done by substitution), then added data types.
